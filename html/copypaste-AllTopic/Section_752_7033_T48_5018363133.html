The contractor shall require the doctor to provide to the contractor a written statement that in his/her medical opinion the employee is physically qualified to engage in the type of activity for which he/she is employed and the employee is physically able to reside in the country to which he/she is assigned. Under a cost reimbursement contract, if the contractor has no written statement of medical opinion on file prior to the departure for the Cooperating Country of any employee and such employee is unable to perform the type of activity for which he/she is employed or cannot complete his/her tour of duty because of any physical disability (other than physical disability arising from an accident while employed under this contract), the contractor shall be responsible for returning the disabled employee to his/her point of hire and providing a replacement at no additional cost to the Government. In addition, in the case of a cost reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not be entitled to reimbursement for any additional costs attributable to delays or other circumstances caused by the employee's inability to complete his/her tour of duty.

As a contribution to the cost of medical examinations, USAID shall reimburse the contractor for the physical examination authorized in paragraph (a) of this section in an amount not to exceed $100 for the physical examination, plus reimbursement of charges for immunizations to the extent not covered by the contractor's health insurance policy.
