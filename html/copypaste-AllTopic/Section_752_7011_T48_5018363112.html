As an addition to or substitution for USAID's sponsored orientation for regular employees, the following types of orientation may be authorized taking into consideration specific job requirements, the employee's prior overseas experience, or unusual circumstances.

                                 <p class="p List1">(c) Authorization for an additional or alternate orientation program, if any, shall be either set forth in the schedule or provided in writing by the contracting officer.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) Travel expenses not to exceed one round trip from regular employee's residence to place of orientation and return will be reimbursed, pursuant to the cost principles applicable to this contract.
