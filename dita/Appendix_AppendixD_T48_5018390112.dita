      <title class="- topic/title ">Appendix D to Chapter 7 - Direct USAID Contracts With a U.S. Citizen or a U.S. Resident Alien for Personal Services Abroad
</title>
      <body>
         <p outputclass="Normal">1. <i>General.</i> (a) <i>Purpose.</i> This appendix sets forth the authority, policy, and procedures under which USAID contracts with a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(b) <i>Definitions.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			<i>Personal services contract (PSC)</i> means a contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) <i>Employer-employee relationship</i> means an employment relationship under a service contract with an individual which occurs when, as a result of the contract's terms or the manner of its administration during performance, the contractor is subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) <i>Non-person services contract</i> means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) <i>Independent contractor relationship</i> means a contract relationship in which the contractor is not subject to the supervision and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. Under this relationship, the Government does not normally supervise the performance of the work, control the days of the week or hours of the day in which it is to be performed, or the location of performance.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(5) <i>Resident hire</i> means a U.S. citizen who, at the time of hire as a PSC, resides in the cooperating country as a spouse or dependent of a U.S. citizen employed by a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-financed contract or agreement, or for reasons other than for employment with a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-financed contract or agreement. A U.S. citizen for purposes of this definition also includes persons who at the time of contracting are lawfully admitted permanent residents of the United States.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(6) <i>U.S. resident alien</i> means a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(7) <i>Abroad</i> means outside the United States and its territories and possessions.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(8) <i>USAID direct-hire employees</i> means civilian employees appointed under USAID Handbook 25 procedures or superseding Automated Directive System (ADS) Chapters.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">2. <i>Legal Basis.</i> (a) Section 635(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the “FAA”) provides the Agency's contracting authority.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2396(a)(3)) authorizes the Agency to enter into personal services contracts with individuals for personal services abroad and provides further that such individuals “* * * shall not be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Civil Service Commission.” 
<sup>1</sup>
                            
                        </p>
                           <p outputclass="Normal">
                              <sup>1</sup> The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of Personnel Management.</p>
                        <p outputclass="Normal">3. <i>Applicability.</i> (a) This appendix applies to all personal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens to provide assistance abroad under Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) This appendix does not apply to:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Nonpersonal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens; such contracts are covered by the basic text of the FAR (48 CFR Chapter 1) and the AIDAR (48 CFR chapter 7).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Personal services contracts with individual Cooperating Country Nationals (CCNs) or Third Country Nationals (TCNs). Such contracts are covered by Appendix J of this chapter.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) Other personal services arrangements covered by USAID Handbook 25 - Employment and Promotion or superseding ADS Chapters.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) Interagency agreements (e.g., PASAs and RSSAs covered by ADS 306 - Interagency Agreements.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">4. <i>Policy.</i> (a) <i>General.</i> USAID may finance, with either program or operating expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services contracts as part of the Agency's program of foreign assistance by entering into a direct contract with an individual U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">
				</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			<i>Program funds.</i> Under the authority of Section 635(h) of the FAA, program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(2) <i>Operating Expense Funds.</i> Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these funds were obligated. Non-recurring cost items may be forward funded for periods not to exceed twenty-four (24) months where necessary and appropriate to accomplishment of the work. 
<sup>2</sup>
                            
                        </p>
                           <p outputclass="Normal">
                              <sup>2</sup> If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years also but funded only as outlined in paragraph 4(a) of this appendix.</p>
                        <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(b) <i>Limitations on Personal Services Contracts.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Personal services contracts may be used for commercial activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, regulations or delegations, U.S. citizen personal services contractors (USPSCs) may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or responsibility delegable to U.S. citizen direct-hire employees (USDH employees) except that:
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">a. They may not supervise U.S. direct-hire employees of USAID or other U.S. Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. citizen employees.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">b. They may not be delegated authority to sign obligating or subobligating documents except when specifically designated as a contracting officer or an agreement officer in accordance with FAR subpart 1.6 and the Agency's applicable warrant program.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">c. They may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a USDH employee.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">d. They may participate in personnel selection matters, but may not be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">e. Exceptions to the limitations in this paragraph (b)(3) must be approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) <i>Exceptions.</i> The Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management (AA/M) must approve exceptions to the limitations in (b)(3). Approval of an exception by the AA/M is not required when the Director, Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance (M/OAA Director) designates a USPSC as a contracting officer or an agreement officer.
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(c) <i>Withholdings and Fringe Benefits.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			Personal services contractors (PSCs) are Government employees for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code) and are, therefore, subject to social security (FICA) and Federal income tax (FIT) withholdings. As employees, they are ineligible for the “foreign earned income” exclusion under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Personal services contractors are treated on par with other Government employees, except for programs based on any law administered by the Federal Office of Personnel Management (e.g., incentive awards, life insurance, health insurance, and retirement programs covered by 5 CFR Parts 530, 531, 831, 870, 871, and 890). While PSCs are ineligible to participate in any of these programs, the following fringe benefits are provided as a matter of policy:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) The employer's FICA contribution for retirement purposes.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) A contribution against the actual cost of the PSC's annual health and life insurance costs. Proof of health and life insurance coverage and its actual cost to the PSC shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is made. (See also paragraph 4(c)(3) of this appendix.)
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(A) The contribution for health insurance shall not exceed 50% of the actual cost to the PSC for his/her annual health insurance, or the maximum U.S. Government contribution for a direct-hire employee, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management, whichever is less. If the PSC is covered under a spouse's health insurance plan, where the spouse's employer pays some or all of the health insurance costs, the cost to the PSC for annual health insurance shall be considered to be zero.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(B) The contribution for life insurance shall be up to 50% of the actual annual costs to the PSC for life insurance, not to exceed $500.00 per year.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability adjustment as U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of funds.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iv) PSCs shall receive a 3% annual salary increase subject to satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluation. Such increase may not exceed 3% without a deviation. This 3% limitation also applies to extensions of the same service or negotiations for a new contract for the same or similar services unless a deviation has been approved.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(v) PSCs shall receive the following allowances and differentials provided in the State Department's Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians Foreign Areas) on the same basis as U.S. Government employees (except for U.S. resident hires, see paragraph 4(d) and Section 12, General Provisions, Clause 22, “U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors”):
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(A) Temporary lodging allowance (Section 120), 
<sup>3</sup>
                            
                        </p>

                              <sup>3</sup> Mission Directors may authorize per diem in lieu of these allowances.</p>
                        <p outputclass="List4">(B) Living quarters allowance (Section 130), 
<sup>3</sup>
                        </p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(C) Post allowance (Section 220),

                        </p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(D) Supplemental post allowance (Section 230), 
<sup>3</sup>
                        </p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(E) Separate maintenance allowance (Section 260), 
<sup>4</sup>
                            
                        </p>
                           <p outputclass="Normal">
                              <sup>4</sup> These allowances are not authorized for short tours (i.e., less than a year).</p>
                        <p outputclass="List4">(F) Education allowance (Section 270), 
<sup>4</sup>
                        </p>

<sup>4</sup>
                        </p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(H) Post differential (Section 500),
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(I) Payments during evacuation/authorized departure (Section 600), and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(J) Danger pay (Section 650).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(vi) Any allowance or differential that is not expressly stated in paragraph 4(c)(2)(v) is not authorized for any PSC unless a deviation is approved. The only exception is a consumables allowance if authorized for the post under Handbook 22 or superseding ADS Chapter.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(vii) Health room services may be provided in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Physical Fitness and Health Room Privileges.”
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(viii) PSCs are eligible to receive benefits for injury, disability, or death under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act since the law is administered by the Department of Labor not the Office of Personnel Management.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ix) PSCs are eligible to earn four hours of annual leave and four hours of sick leave for each two week period. However, PSCs with previous service are eligible to earn annual leave in accordance with the “Leave and Holidays” General Provision contract clause in section 12 of this appendix.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) A PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraph 4(c)(2)(ii) of this appendix.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contract (since the Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree) unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. If coverage overseas is excluded, then eligibility as cited in paragraph 4(c)(3) applies.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(5) Retired U.S. Government employees may be awarded Personal Services Contracts without any reduction in or offset against their Government annuity.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(d) <i>U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors.</i> U.S. resident-hire PSCs are not eligible for any fringe benefits (except contributions for FICA, health insurance, and life insurance), including differentials and allowances unless such individuals can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that they have received similar benefits and allowances from their immediately previous employer in the cooperating country, or the Mission Director may determine that payment of such benefits would be consistent with the Mission's policy and practice and would be in the best interests of the U.S. Government.
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(e) <i>Determining salary for personal services contractors.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			There are two separate and distinct methods of establishing a salary for personal services contractors. Use of method number 1 is required unless justified and approved as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) <i>Method 1:</i> Salaries for Personal Services Contractors shall be established based on the market value in the United States of the position being recruited for. This requires the Contracting Officer in coordination with the Technical Officer to determine the correct market value (a salary range) of the position to be filled. This method is required in establishing salary for all PSCs unless method 2 is authorized as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii). Contract Information Bulletin (CIB) 96-8 dated February 23, 1996 provides a guide which contains information concerning Preparation of Scopes of Work, Determination of Salary Class Grade, Salary Class Bench Marks and Salary Class Review. The market value of the position then becomes the basis along with the applicants' certified salary history on the SF 171, “Personal Qualifications Statement” for salary negotiations by the Contracting Officer. The SF 171 must be retained in the permanent contract file. Any position which is determined to be above the GS-13 equivalent and exceeds six months in duration must be classified by M/HR/POD. The crucial point is the establishment of a realistic and reasonable market value for a job. The final determination regarding the reasonableness of a salary level rests with the Contracting Officer. Paying salaries using this method avoids “rank in person” salaries which are in excess of the value of the job being contracted for.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) <i>Method 2:</i> If approved in writing by the Mission Director or the cognizant Assistant Administrator, based on written justification, salary may be negotiated based on the applicant's current earnings adjusted in accordance with the factors set out in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) 
				</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(A) 
			through (C). This approval requirement cannot be redelegated. Current earnings must be certified by the contractor on the SF 171, (see paragraph 6(b)(3) of this appendix). This is guidance for establishing initial salaries, not subsequent increases, for the same contractor performing the same function.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(A) As a rule, up to a 3 percent increase above current earnings may be given. However, a 3 percent increase is awarded only to a PSC whose earnings are based on a period of twelve months or more; 2 percent for established earnings of less than twelve months but not less than four months; or 1 percent for established earnings during the past four months.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(B) Additional percentages may be given for the following factors. If a PSC has worked in a developing country for more than two years, an additional 1 percent may be awarded. Education related to the area of specialization and above the minimum qualification required may warrant an additional 1 percent, and those specialties for which there is keen competition in the employment market or a serious shortage category nationwide may be awarded an additional 2 percent. In addition, related technical experience over 5 years may increase the percentage by 1 and over ten years by 3.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(C) All requests for an initial rate of pay above 10 percent over current earnings must be approved in writing by the appropriate Assistant Administrator or Mission Director. Current earnings are actual earnings for work reasonably related to the position for which the applicant is being considered. Paragraphs 4(e)(1)(ii) (A) through (C) apply only to salary setting method number 2 in paragraph 4 (e)(1)(ii).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) When an applicant has no current earnings history (e.g., a person returning to the workforce after an absence of a number of years) or when an applicant's current earnings history doesn't accurately reflect the applicant's job market worth (e.g., a Peace Corps volunteer), every effort should be made to establish a market value for the position as a basis for negotiation, notwithstanding the lack of a current earnings history, provided that the applicant has the full qualifications for the job and could command a similar salary in the open job market.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) This appendix applies the “USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST)” policy in Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 302.3.6.8 to salaries for U.S. PSCs. Salaries in excess of the USAID CST, which is equivalent to the maximum rate for Federal agencies without a certified SES performance appraisal system, must be approved by the M/OAA Director in accordance with the approval procedures in ADS 302.3.6.8(e). This approval cannot be re-delegated.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(f) <i>Incentive awards.</i> U.S. personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in, or be funded under, the incentive-awards program administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for USAID U.S. direct-hire employees in accordance with section 636(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. U.S. personal services contractors are eligible to receive certain monetary and non-monetary incentive awards as authorized under this section. All nominations for incentive awards must be approved by a U.S. direct-hire employee, who is either the contractor's supervisor or is at the next higher level within the Mission/Bureau/Independent Office (M/B/IO). The list of incentive awards and detailed eligibility, nomination, and approval processes are specified in internal Agency policies in Chapter 309 of Automated Directive System (ADS), available on the USAID website. These awards will be funded from the authorizations used to fund the specific contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(g) <i>Annual salary increase.</i> PSC contracts written for more than one year should provide for a 3% annual increase based on satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluations.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(h) <i>Pay comparability adjustment.</i> PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability adjustment as that received by U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of funds.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(i) <i>Subcontracting.</i> PSCs are U.S. Government employees and may not be called upon (or permitted) to subcontract out any part of their work. Funds for subcontracting have no place in the budget of a personal services contract. Support services, equipment, and supplies (e.g., typing and report preparation, paper, pens, computers, and furniture) should be furnished to PSCs just as they would be to direct-hire employees. To the extent that direct-hire personnel may be authorized to purchase supporting services or supplies under a travel authorization, so may PSCs; otherwise, contracts for personal services should not contain any funds for procurement.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">5. <i>Soliciting for Personal Services Contracts.</i> (a) <i>Technical Officer's responsibilities.</i> The Technical Officer will prepare a written detailed statement of duties and a statement of minimum qualifications to cover the position being recruited for. The statement shall be included in the procurement request (the Acquisition &amp; Assistance Request Document) e.g., the request shall also include the following additional information as a minimum:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">
				</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of frequency);
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(2) The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, plus any options for renewal or extension;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(3) The basic education, training, experience, and skills required for the position;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(4) An estimate of what a comparable GS/FS equivalent position should cost, including basic salary, allowances, and differentials, if appropriate; and 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(5) A list of Government or host country furnished items (e.g., housing).
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(b) <i>Contracting Officer's responsibilities.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall contain:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) Three sets of SF 171s and SF 171As. (Upon receipt, one copy of each SF 171 and SF 171A shall be forwarded to the Project Officer.)
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) A detailed statement of duties or a completed position description for the position being recruited for.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract Schedule, General Provisions as appropriate, as well as the FAR Clauses to be incorporated in full text and by reference.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iv) A copy of the USAID General Notice entitled “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct”.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) The Contracting Officer shall comply with the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) except those recruited from the U.S.
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(c) <i>Competition.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			Under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts (except those recruited from the U.S.) are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances, and 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) A justification supporting less than full and open competition must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) <i>PSCs with Untied States citizens or resident aliens recruited from outside the cooperating country.</i> Solicitations for PSCs recruited outside the cooperating country must be publicized via the Agency's External Home Page on the Internet under the caption “Business &amp; Procurement, USAID Procurements.” Instructions regarding how to access the External Internet and the information to be provided have been approved and included in a CIB. A justification under FAR 6.303 is not required when this procedure is followed.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement Executive to satisfy the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) for a justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. This class justification for Personal Services Contracts with U.S. Citizens may only be used for those who are recruited locally subject to the following conditions:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) The position was publicized locally in accordance with established Mission policy or procedure, or the procedures in paragraph 5(c)(ii) was followed;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs 5(c) (i) and (ii), at least 3 individuals were considered by consulting source lists (e.g., applications or resumes on hand) or conducting other informal solicitation.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) Extensions or renewals with the same individual for continuing services do not need to be publicized.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iv) A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant to (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this class justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is fair and reasonable.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) If the appropriate competitive procedure in paragraph 5(3) is not followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate justification as required under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(5) Since the award of a Personal Services Contract is based on technical qualifications, not price, and since the SF 171, “Personal Qualifications Statement”, and SF 171A, “Continuation Sheet for Standard Form 171”, are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR subparts 15.4 and 15.5 and FAR parts 52 and 53 are inappropriate and shall not be used. Instead, the solicitation and selection procedures outlined in this Appendix shall govern.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">6. <i>Negotiating a Personal Services Contract.</i> Negotiating a Personal Services Contract is significantly different from negotiating a nonpersonal services contract because it establishes an employer-employee relationship; therefore, the selection procedures are more akin to the personnel selection procedures.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) <i>Technical Officer's responsibilities.</i> The Technical Officer shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications (i.e., SF 171s) received in response to the solicitation issued by the Contracting Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted with the applicants before the final selection is submitted to the Contracting Officer.
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(b) <i>Contracting Officer's responsibilities.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of each SF 171 received under the solicitation to the Project Officer for evaluation.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) On receipt of the Technical Officer's recommendation, the Contracting Officer shall conduct negotiations with the recommended applicant. Normally, the Contracting Officer shall negotiate only the salary (see the salary setting coverage in paragraph 4(e) of this Appendix). The terms and conditions of the contract, including differentials and allowances, are not negotiable or waivable without a properly approved deviation (see (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470). If the Contracting Officer can negotiate a salary that is fair and reasonable, then the award shall be made.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history on the SF 171 as the basis for salary negotiations, along with the market value of the position being recruited for (unless approval not to use market value has been granted under paragraph 4(e)(1)(ii)), and the Technical Officer's cost estimate.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) The Contracting Officer will obtain two copies of IRS Form W-4, “Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate”, from the successful applicant. (Upon receipt, the Contracting Officer will forward one copy of the W-4 to the Office of the Controller.)
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(5) Security clearance is required for all U.S. citizens entering into USAID PSCs. The Contracting Officer will obtain four sets of SF 86, “Security Investigation Data for Sensitive Position”, from the successful applicant and forward them to the Office of Security. PSCs may receive a preliminary clearance and be placed under contract prior to receipt of clearance provided the appropriate paper work has been completed, reviewed by IG/SEC/PSI and acknowledged as a “no objection” to the appropriate Mission. See General Provision 24 in section 12 of this appendix.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">7. <i>Executing a Personal Services Contract.</i> Contracting Officers or Heads of Contracting Activities, whether USAID/W or Mission, may execute Personal Services Contracts, provided that the amount of the contract does not exceed the contracting authority that has been redelegated to them. In executing a Personal Services Contract, the Contracting Officer is responsible for insuring that:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(a) The proposed contract is within his/her delegated authority;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) A Request Number covering the proposed contract has been received;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(c) The position has been classified by either the Mission or M/HR/POD (see CIB 96-8) and the classification is in the contract file;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(d) The proposed Statement of Duties is contractible, contains a statement of minimum qualifications from the technical office requesting the services, and is suitable to the use of a Personal Services Contract in that:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Performance of the proposed work requires or is best suited for an employer-employee relationship, and is thus not suited to the use of a non-personal services contract;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) The Statement of Duties does not require performance of any function normally reserved for Federal employees (see paragraph 4(b) of this Appendix); and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) There is no apparent conflict of interest involved (if the Contracting Officer believes that a conflict of interest may exist, the question should be referred to the cognizant legal counsel);
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(e) Selection of the contractor is documented and justified. (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)
				</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			provides an exception to the requirement for full and open competition for Personal Services Contracts abroad (see paragraph 5(c) of this appendix);
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(f) The standard contract format prescribed for Personal Services Contracts (Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 to this appendix) is used; or that any necessary deviations are processed as required by (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">(Note: The prescribed contract format is designed for use with contractors who are residing in the U.S. when hired. If the contract is with a U.S. citizen residing in the cooperating country when hired, contract provisions governing physical fitness and travel/transportation expenses, and home leave, allowances, and orientation should be suitably modified (see paragraph 4(d) of this appendix)).
</p>
         <p outputclass="FP">These modifications are not considered deviations subject to (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470. (Justification and explanation of these modifications is to be included in the contract file);
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(g) Orientation is arranged in accordance with General Provision 23 in section 12 of this appendix;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(h) The contractor has submitted the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of at least two persons who may be notified in the event of an emergency (this information is to be retained in the contract file);
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(i) The contract is complete and correct and all information required on the contract Cover Page (USAID Form 1420-36A) has been entered;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(j) The contract has been signed by the Contracting Office and the contractor, and fully executed copies are properly distributed;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(k) The following clearances, approvals and forms have been obtained, properly completed, and placed in the contract file before the contract is signed by both parties;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) Evidence of job classification in the file by the Mission except for grade equivalents above GS-13. For those positions with grade equivalent above GS-13, evidence of job classification done by M/HR/POD;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Security clearance, including the completed SF 86, to the extent required by USAID Handbook 6, Security or superseding ADS Chapter, (see General Provisions 14 and 24 in section 12 of this appendix);
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(3) Mission, host country, Human Resources Office, and technical office clearance, as appropriate;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) Medical examinations and certifications as required by the contract general provision entitled “Physical Fitness and Health Room Privileges”;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(5) One original executed IRS Form W-4 entitled “Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate”, and one copy, shall be obtained. The original shall be sent to the Controller of the paying office and one shall be placed in the contract file;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(6) Evidence of DAA/HR clearance that the position may be filled by PSC.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(7) The approval for any salary in excess of the “USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST)”, which is equivalent to the maximum rate for Federal agencies without a certified SES performance appraisal system, in accordance with approval procedures in ADS 302.3.6.8(e) as required in Section 4.(e)(3);
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(8) A copy of the class justification or other appropriate explanation and support required by (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70, if applicable;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(9) Any deviation to the policy or procedures of this appendix, processed and approved under (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(10) A fully executed SF 171, and a copy of the position classification, and approved deviation, if appropriate;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(11) The Memorandum of Negotiation; and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(12) The Contracting Officer's signed certification that competition requirements have been satisfied as described in paragraph 5(c) of the policy text of this Appendix. The certification shall be a part of the Memorandum of Negotiations.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(l) Funds for the contract are properly obligated to preclude violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341 (the Contracting Officer ensures that the contract has been properly recorded by the appropriate accounting office prior to its release for the signature of the selected contractor);
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(m) The contractor receives and understands the USAID General Notice entitled “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct” and a copy is attached to each contract as provided for in paragraph (c) of General Provision 1, section 12;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(n) Agency conflict of interest requirements as set out in the General Notice “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct” are met by the contractor prior to his/her reporting for duty;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(o) A copy of a Checklist for Personal Services contractors which may be in the format set out in this section or another format convenient for the Contracting Officer, provided that a memorandum containing all of the information described in this section 7 shall be prepared for each PSC and placed in the contract file;
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(p) The contractor understands that he/she is an employee of the United States for purposes of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code). This subjects the employee to withholding for both FICA and Federal Income Tax and precludes the employee from receiving the Federal Earned Income Tax exclusion of 26 U.S.C. Section 911. See Special Note on the Cover Page of USAID Form 1420-36.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(q) The contractor also understands that he/she may commence work prior to the completion of the security clearance. However, until such time as clearance is received, the contractor may not have access to classified or administratively controlled materials. Failure to obtain clearances will constitute cause for termination.

</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) If the contract period of performance is ninety (90) calendar days or more, and the contractor's performance is not continuous during the contract period of performance, the contractor is entitled to accrue annual leave only for each instance of continuous performance of ninety (90) calendar days or more.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) If the contract period of performance is less than ninety (90) calendar days, the contractor is not entitled to accrue annual leave.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) The rate at which the contractor will accrue annual leave is based on the contractor's time in service according to the table of this paragraph (a)(2). The accrual rates are based on a full-time, 40-hour workweek, which will be prorated if the contract provides for a shorter workweek:

                        <p outputclass="List1">(i) USAID will calculate the time in service based on all the previous service performed by the contractor as - :
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(A) An individual personal services contractor with USAID for any duration covered by Sec. 636(a)(3) of the FAA or other statutory authority applicable to USAID; and/or
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(B) A former U.S. Government (USG) direct-hire civilian employee; and/or
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(C) An honorable active duty member of the uniformed services based on the definition in 5 U.S.C. 2101(3).
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(ii) In addition to the information certified by the contractor in their Offeror Information form, the contracting officer may require the contractor to furnish copies of previously executed contracts, and/or other evidence of previous service (<i>e.g.,</i> SF 50, DD Form 214 or 215) to conduct the due diligence necessary to verify creditable previous service.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">(3) Annual Leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of providing the contractor necessary rest and recreation during the period of performance. The contractor, in consultation with the Supervisor, must develop an annual leave schedule early in the period of performance, taking into consideration the requirements of the position, the contractor's preference, and other factors. The maximum amount of annual leave that the contractor can carry over from one leave year to the next is limited to 240 hours. The contractor's unused annual leave balance in excess of the 240 hour maximum at the end of the last pay period of each leave year will be forfeited, unless the requirements of the position precluded the contractor from taking such leave. The contractor may be authorized to restore annual leave for exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. The restoration of annual leave may be approved only by the USAID Administrator, cognizant Assistant Administrator or Head of an Independent Office reporting directly to the USAID Administrator, and cannot be delegated further. Annual leave restored must be scheduled and used no later than the earlier of either - 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(i) The end of the leave year two years after the date fixed by the approving official as the termination date of the exceptional circumstances beyond the contractor's control, which resulted in the forfeiture; or
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(ii) The end of the contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">(4) The contractor must use all accrued annual leave during the period of performance. At the end of the contract, the contractor will forfeit any unused annual leave except where the requirements of the position precluded the contractor from taking annual leave. In this case, the contracting officer may authorize the following:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(i) The contractor to take annual leave during the concluding weeks of the contract, not to exceed the period of performance; or
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(ii) Payment of a lump-sum for annual leave not taken based on a signed, written determination and findings (D&amp;F) from the contractor's supervisor. The D&amp;F must set out the facts and circumstances that prevented the contractor from taking annual leave, and the contracting officer must find that the contractor did not cause, or have the ability to control, such facts and circumstances. This lump-sum payment must not exceed the number of days the contractor could have accrued during a twelve (12)-month period based on the contractor's accrual rate.
</p>
         <p outputclass="Normal">(5) The contractor may be granted advanced annual leave by the contracting officer when circumstances warrant. Advanced leave must be approved by the Mission Director, cognizant Assistant Administrator, or Head of an Independent Office reporting directly to the Administrator, as appropriate. In no case may the contracting officer grant advanced annual leave in excess of the amount the contractor can accrue in a twelve (12)-month period or over the life of the contract, whichever is less. At the end of the period of performance or at termination, the contractor must reimburse USAID for any outstanding balance of advanced annual leave provided to the contractor under the contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(b) <i>Sick Leave.</i> The contractor may use sick leave on the same basis and for the same purposes as USAID direct-hire employees. The contractor will accrue sick leave at a rate not to exceed four (4) hours every two (2) weeks for a maximum of thirteen (13) work-days per year based on a full-time, 40-hour workweek, and the rate of accrual will be prorated if the contract provides for a shorter workweek. The contractor may carry over unused sick leave from year to year under the same contract, and to a new follow-on contract for the same work at the same place of performance. The contractor is not authorized to carry over sick leave to a new contract for a different position or at a different location. The contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract.
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(c) <i>Home Leave.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			The contractor may be granted home leave to be taken only in the U.S., its commonwealth, possessions, or territories, in one continuous period, under the following conditions:
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) The contractor must complete twenty-four (24) continuous months of service abroad under this contract, and must not have taken more than thirty (30) workdays leave (annual, sick, or LWOP) in the U.S., its commonwealths, possessions, or territories. The required service abroad will include the actual days in orientation in the U.S. (excluding any language training), travel time by the most direct route, and actual days abroad beginning on the date of arrival in the cooperating country. Any annual and sick leave taken abroad, excluding leave without pay (LWOP), will count toward the period of service abroad. Any days of annual and sick leave taken in the U.S., its commonwealths, possessions, or territories will not be counted toward the required twenty-four (24) months of service abroad.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) The contractor must agree to return immediately after completing home leave to continue performance for an additional -

</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) If the contractor agrees to meet the conditions in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause above by returning to the same USAID Mission under this contract or a new contract, the contractor may be granted thirty (30) workdays of home leave.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iv) If the contractor agrees to meet the continued performance conditions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause and will be relocating to a different USAID Mission under a new USAID personal services contract immediately following the completion of home leave, the contractor may be granted twenty (20) workdays of home leave. USAID will provide the contractor these twenty days of home leave under this contract, not under the new contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(v) If home leave eligibility is based on paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this clause, prior to departure on home leave, the contractor must submit to the contracting officer at the current Mission, a copy of the new contract with a special award condition in the contract Schedule indicating the contractor's obligation to fulfill the commitment for continued performance in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, the contractor may be granted advanced home leave subject to all of the following conditions:

         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) The contractor has served at least eighteen (18) months abroad, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this clause, at the same USAID Mission under this contract, and has not taken more than 30 work days leave (annual, sick or LWOP) in the U.S.; and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) The contractor agrees to return immediately to the same Mission to complete the time remaining to meet the twenty-four (24) month period of service required for home leave, which begins after the contractor returns from home leave, plus an additional -

</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List2">(3)
				</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) 
			Home leave must be taken only in the U.S., its commonwealths, possessions, or territories. Any days spent in any other location will be charged to annual leave, or if the contractor does not have accrued annual leave to cover these days, the contractor will be placed on LWOP.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(ii) Travel time by the most direct route is authorized in addition to the home leave authorized under this “Leave and Holidays” clause. Salary during travel to and from the U.S. for home leave will be limited to the time required for travel by the most direct and expeditious route. Additional home leave travel requirements are included in the “Travel and Transportation Expenses” clause of this contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iii) Except for reasons beyond the contractor's control as determined by the contracting officer, the contractor must return abroad immediately after home leave to fulfill the additional required continued performance of services for any home leave provided under this contract, or else the contractor must reimburse USAID for the salary and benefits costs of home leave, travel and transportation, and any other payments related to home leave.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(iv) Unused home leave is not reimbursable under this contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(4) The contracting officer may authorize the contractor to spend no more than five (5) days in work status for consultation at USAID/Washington while on home leave in the U.S., before returning abroad. Consultation in excess of five (5) days or at locations other than USAID/Washington must be approved in advance by the Mission Director or the contracting officer.
</p>
         <p props="Runin" outputclass="List1">(d) <i>Home Leave for Qualifying Posts.</i> 
				     </p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(1) 
			If the contractor ordinarily qualifies for home leave and has completed a 12-month period at one of the USAID qualifying Missions, as announced by the Department of State or USAID, the contractor is entitled to ten (10) workdays of home leave in addition to the home leave the contractor is normally entitled to in accordance with paragraph (c) of this “Leave and Holidays” clause.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(2) There is no requirement that an eligible contractor take this additional home leave for qualifying Missions; it is for use at the contractor's option. If the contractor is eligible and elects to take such home leave, the contractor must take all ten (10) workdays at one time in the U.S. under the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this clause. If the contractor is returning to the U.S. and not returning abroad to the same or different USAID Mission, the contractor is not eligible for home leave for qualifying Missions, and this paragraph (d) will not apply.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(e) <i>Holidays and Administrative Leave.</i> The contractor is entitled to all holidays and administrative leave granted by USAID to U.S. direct-hire employees as announced by the Agency or Mission.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(f) <i>Military Leave.</i> Military leave of not more than fifteen (15) calendar days in any calendar year may be granted to the contractor who is a reservist of the U.S. Armed Forces, provided that the military leave has been approved, in advance, by the contracting officer or the Mission Director. A copy of the contractor's official orders and the contracting officer or Mission Director approval will be part of the contract file.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(g) <i>Leave Without Pay (LWOP).</i> The contractor may be granted LWOP only with the written approval of the contracting officer or Mission Director, unless a such leave is requested for family and medical leave purposes under paragraph (i) of this clause.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List1">(h) <i>Compensatory Time.</i> USAID may grant compensatory time off only with the written approval of the contracting officer or Mission Director in rare instances when it has been determined absolutely essential and under the policies that apply to USAID U.S. direct-hire employees. The contractor may use earned compensatory time off in accordance with policies that apply to USAID direct-hire employees

USAID also provides family and medical leave to eligible USPSCs working outside the U.S., or any territories or possession of the U.S., in accordance with this paragraph 
				</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(i) 
			outside the provisions of Title I of the FMLA as a matter of policy discretion.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(2) Family and medical leave only applies to USPSCs, not any other type of PSC.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(3) In accordance with 29 CFR 825.110, to be eligible for family and medical leave, the contractor must have performed services for  - 
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(i) At least twelve (12) months with USAID; and
</p>
         <p outputclass="List4">(ii) At least 1,250 hours with USAID during the previous 12-month period.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(4) In accordance with 29 CFR 825.200(a), and USAID's internal policies available in Automated Directive System Chapter 309 (ADS 309), an eligible contractor may take up to twelve (12) workweeks of leave under FMLA, Title I, in any 12-month period for the reasons specified in 29 CFR 825.112.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(5) In accordance with 29 CFR 825.207, the contractor may take LWOP for family and medical leave purposes. However, the contractor may choose to substitute LWOP with accrued annual or sick leave earned under the terms of this contract. If the contractor does not choose to substitute accrued paid leave, the contracting officer, in consultation with the contractor's supervisor, may require the contractor to substitute accrued paid leave for LWOP. The CO must obtain the required certifications for approval of family medical leave in accordance with USAID policy. The contractor must notify the contractor's Supervisor of the intent to substitute paid leave for LWOP prior to the date such paid leave commences. After having invoked the entitlement to family and medical leave and taking LWOP for that purpose, the contractor cannot retroactively substitute paid leave for the LWOP already taken under family and medical leave.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(6) Family medical leave is not authorized for any period beyond the completion date of this contract.
</p>
         <p outputclass="List3">(7) When requesting family medical leave, the contractor must submit the relevant leave request in writing, including certifications and other supporting documents required by 29 CFR 825 and USAID policy in ADS 309.

</p>
         <p outputclass="List2">(6) <i>Payments during evacuation.</i> The Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) provide the authority for efficient, orderly, and equitable procedure for the payment of compensation, post differential and allowances in the event of an emergency evacuation of employees or their dependents, or both, from duty stations for military or other reasons or because of imminent danger to their lives. If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission Director, the contractor will receive payments during evacuation for himself/herself and authorized dependents evacuated from their post of assignment in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended.

Consequently, the post differential may be reduced while danger pay is in effect to avoid dual crediting for political violence. The contractor shall be allowed danger pay allowance not to exceed that paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 650, as from time to time amended.
